# Employee Database CMS

## Description

This week, I'm exploring SQL queries! I've been looking forward to implementing a MySQL database, because I have a lot of experience working with [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org), an open-source CRM that we used at Bay Area Children's Theatre to run all of our ticketing, class registration, and donation systems.

| _As a hypothetical business owner, I'd like an application that allows me to see and interact with my employee data. I'd like to be able to see a list of employees, departments, roles, etc. I'd like to be able to update and add to those lists. I'd like to be able to see the sum total of a given department's salaries._ |
